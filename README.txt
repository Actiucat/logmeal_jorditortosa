In this test it was required to create a web page with 3 main functionalities.
The first one was to upload an image from the computer or providing an url.
The second one was to analyze an image given the id of an image, as a result it would show the size of the image.
The last functionality was a list of the id of the images uploaded before.

In the project we can found a file called 'app.py' containing the python code of the web, 
all the dokerfiles aswell as the docker-compose.yml and the requirements.txt, 
the uploads folder where the images are stored 
and the templates folder where, inside there is the index.html containing the front-end part of the web.

To run the code you have to use the command 'python .\app\app.py ' from the path of the project and click on the link where it is running.
There you can see the web page with all the functionalities required.

When it comes to planification the first step was to understand the assignment.
Once I really knew what I was asked to do I tried to learn or improve in the technologies I did not know about or I was not very confident in, like 'Docker' or 'Flask'.
After that I began with the development.
